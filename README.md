Your diabetes monitor


### Main screen
![MainScreen](https://github.com/HanSolo/Sugr-Mon/raw/main/screenshots/MainScreen.png)

This screen shows you the most important information at a glance. You can find information about:
- Current blood glucose value incl. trend
- Current unit
- Average blood glucose value for today
- Percentage of time in range (TIR) for today
- The HbA1c (based on the values from the last 30 days)
- Percentage of time in range (TIR) for the last 30 days

The background color of the upper part will change with the current blood glucose value.
The available colors are as follows:
- RED (blood glucose too high or too low)
- ORANGE (blood glucose high or low)
- YELLOW (blood glucose acceptable high or acceptable low)
- GREEN (blood glucose good)

The values for the different ranges can partly be adjusted in the settings.

You will find a line of colored squares for the last 30 days which shows the average value for
each day by it's color. The same colors will be used as for the current value e.g. if the average
value of a day was high, the square will be orange.

In the middle part of the main screen you will see two charts, the bar chart on the upper area
shows the deltas between two measured blood glucose values. This chart can help you to estimate the
next value (esp. if it drops quickly it can help you to be prepared in case the value will be too low soon).

Below the bar chart you will find a line chart that shows the measured blood glucose values as dots with
a fill color defined by the value. You will also find the actual number above each dot.

In the line chart you will also find a green area which indicates the "good range" of blood glucose values.
The x-axis of the charts will show you the time. 

Both charts can be scrolled horizontally and will contain the values of the last 24 hours
